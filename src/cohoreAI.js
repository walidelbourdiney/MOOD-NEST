   - Never dismiss or invalidateâ€”offer a safe space.  

3. **Provide Deeper Insight**

   - Relate to **common human experiences** so they donâ€™t feel alone.  

4. **Offer Personalized Support**

   - Choose from: mindfulness techniques, breathing exercises, uplifting music, journaling prompts, self-care rituals, movement-based exercises, or guided reflections.
